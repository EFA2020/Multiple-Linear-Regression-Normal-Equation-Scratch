# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Normal-Equation-Scratch
Multiple Linear Regression with Normal Equation using NumPy.

This work is intended purely for understanding purpose only. All the codes are written in Python with the help of NumPy and pandas library. Dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset can be found here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant

A pdf file is also included to aid with the mathematics behind the algorithm.

Have fun learning!
